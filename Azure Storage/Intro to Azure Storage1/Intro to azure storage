Core Storage services

Bennefits - Built to offer durable, highly available, encryption, security, scalable, accessibility

Blob Storage - Provides object storage for the cloud
- Optimized to support massive amounts of unstructured data
- unstructured data is data that does not fit a specific data model
- Text and Binary are examples of this type of data

Azure Files- Fully managed file share system available in the cloud

Block Blob storage accounts
- Premium performance for block blobs and append blobs
- Used for situations where high transaction rates are in play
- for scenarios that requre low storage latency

File storage account
